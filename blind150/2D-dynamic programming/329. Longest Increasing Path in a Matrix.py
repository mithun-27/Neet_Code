#329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix
"""Given an m x n integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in matrix.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
Example 3:

Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1"""
