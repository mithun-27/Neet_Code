#981. Time Based Key-Value Store
"""Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the TimeMap class:

TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns "".
 

Example 1:

Input
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]
Output
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]

Explanation
TimeMap timeMap = new TimeMap();
timeMap.set("foo", "bar", 1);  // store the key "foo" and value "bar" along with timestamp = 1.
timeMap.get("foo", 1);         // return "bar"
timeMap.get("foo", 3);         // return "bar", since there is no value corresponding to foo at timestamp 3 and timestamp 2, then the only value is at timestamp 1 is "bar".
timeMap.set("foo", "bar2", 4); // store the key "foo" and value "bar2" along with timestamp = 4.
timeMap.get("foo", 4);         // return "bar2"
timeMap.get("foo", 5);         // return "bar2"
 

Constraints:

1 <= key.length, value.length <= 100
key and value consist of lowercase English letters and digits.
1 <= timestamp <= 107
All the timestamps timestamp of set are strictly increasing.
At most 2 * 105 calls will be made to set and get."""

                r = m - 1
        return res

"""walkthrough:
1. Initialize a dictionary to store the key-value pairs along with their timestamps.
2. In the set method, check if the key exists in the dictionary. If not, create an empty list for that key. Append the value and timestamp as a list to the key's list.
3. In the get method, retrieve the list of values for the given key. If the key does not exist, return an empty string. Use binary search to find the value with the largest timestamp that is less than or equal to the given timestamp. Return the corresponding value if found, otherwise return an empty string.    
4. The time complexity of the set method is O(1) and the time complexity of the get method is O(log n) due to the binary search. The overall space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of set operations performed.
