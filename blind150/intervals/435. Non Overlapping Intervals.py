#435. Non Overlapping Intervals
"""Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note: Intervals are non-overlapping even if they have a common point. For example, [1, 3] and [2, 4] are overlapping, but [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.

Example 1:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,4]]

Output: 1
Explanation: After [1,4] is removed, the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

Example 2:

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,4]]

Output: 0
Constraints:

1 <= intervals.length <= 100,000
intervals[i].length == 2
-50000 <= starti < endi <= 50000
