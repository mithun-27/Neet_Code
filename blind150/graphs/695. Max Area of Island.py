#695. Max Area of Island
"""You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 50
grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1."""

"""Walkthrough:
1. We want to find the maximum area of an island in the given binary matrix, where an island is formed by connected `1`s in the four directions (up, down, left, and right).
2. We iterate through every cell in the grid. Whenever we encounter a cell containing `1`, we start a depth-first search (DFS) to calculate the area of that island.
3. During the DFS, we first check whether the current cell is out of bounds or contains `0`. If either condition is true, we return `0` because it does not contribute to the island's area.
4. If the current cell contains `1`, we mark it as visited (for example, by changing its value to `0`) so that it is not counted again in future searches.
5. We initialize the current island's area as `1` for the current cell, then recursively explore its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, and right).
6. The recursive calls return the areas contributed by the neighboring land cells, and we add these values to the current island's area.
7. Once the DFS finishes, it returns the total area of the current island. We compare this value with the maximum area found so far and update the answer if necessary.
8. We continue scanning the remaining cells in the grid until every island has been explored exactly once.
9. The algorithm returns the largest island area found. The time complexity is `O(m × n)` because each cell is visited at most once, and the auxiliary space complexity is `O(m × n)` in the worst case due to the recursion stack (excluding the input grid)."""
